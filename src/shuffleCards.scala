/**
 * This file contains functions to perform a Faro Suffle.
 * A perfect Faro shuffle breaks up the stack into two sub-stacks of exactly the same size,
 * and then combines them in the manner described above.
 * An out-shuffle results in the top and the bottom cards of the stack remaining the same after the shuffle;
 * an in-shuffle results in these cards becoming the second and the second last cards of the shuffled stack.
